    markScheme: 'From Source A, we can learn that Elizabeth I maintained a complex relationship with Parliament. The source suggests that Elizabeth was assertive in her royal authority, stating that "she would not be bound by Parliament\'s wishes." This indicates that she was determined to preserve the royal prerogative and resist any attempts by Parliament to constrain her power. However, the source also reveals that Elizabeth was politically pragmatic, as it mentions that "she carefully balanced royal authority with the need for political cooperation." This suggests she recognized the importance of maintaining good relations with Parliament despite asserting her independence. Additionally, the source shows that Elizabeth employed specific strategies when dealing with Parliament, using "delay and ambiguity" to avoid direct confrontation while still pursuing her own objectives. Overall, the source portrays Elizabeth as a shrewd political operator who carefully managed her relationship with Parliament to maintain her authority while avoiding serious conflict.',

    markScheme: 'Prohibition was introduced in the USA in 1919 due to several interconnected factors. Firstly, the temperance movement had been campaigning against alcohol for decades, organizations like the Anti-Saloon League and the Women\'s Christian Temperance Union gained significant political influence by the early 20th century. These groups argued that alcohol was destroying family life and causing poverty and domestic violence. The ASL in particular adopted an effective single-issue political strategy, supporting any candidate who backed prohibition regardless of party.\n\nReligious factors were also crucial, as many Protestant denominations viewed alcohol consumption as sinful. The growing influence of evangelical Christianity, particularly in rural areas, created a moral imperative for prohibition. This religious motivation was connected to wider social concerns about maintaining traditional American values against the perceived threats of urbanization and immigration.\n\nWorld War I provided a decisive context for prohibition\'s implementation. Anti-German sentiment during the war targeted German-American brewers, connecting alcohol to "un-American" activities. Additionally, the wartime need for grain conservation made alcohol production seem unpatriotic and wasteful. The Lever Food and Fuel Control Act (1917) temporarily prohibited the use of grain for distilling alcohol, creating a precedent for national prohibition.\n\nPolitical developments also facilitated prohibition\'s introduction. Progressive Era reforms aimed at addressing social problems made government intervention in personal behavior more acceptable. Many progressives supported prohibition as a way to improve public health and workplace efficiency. The introduction of a federal income tax in 1913 also reduced government dependence on alcohol taxes, removing a major financial obstacle to prohibition.\n\nFinally, changing demographics contributed to prohibition\'s success. Rural America, which generally supported prohibition, was overrepresented in Congress. As urbanization and immigration increased, many rural Protestant Americans saw prohibition as a way to maintain control over the country\'s social fabric.\n\nThese various factors converged in the passage of the 18th Amendment in 1919, making the production, transport, and sale of alcohol illegal throughout the United States.',
