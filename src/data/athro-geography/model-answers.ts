    markScheme: 'Rivers create meanders and oxbow lakes through a combination of erosion and deposition processes. In a straight river channel, water flows faster in the middle (thalweg) and slower at the edges due to friction with the banks. When there is a slight bend in the river, the main flow of water is thrown against the outer bank by inertia. This creates stronger erosion on the outer bend through hydraulic action and corrasion, forming a river cliff or bluff. The water slows on the inner bend, causing deposition of sediment which creates a gentle slip-off slope or point bar.\n\nOver time, this process of erosion on the outer bend and deposition on the inner bend becomes self-reinforcing. The meander becomes more pronounced and begins to migrate downstream through continued erosion and deposition. As this process continues, the neck of the meander (the narrow piece of land between two bends) becomes increasingly narrow.\n\nEventually, during a period of high discharge (such as a flood), the river may cut through this narrow neck, creating a new, straighter channel. This process is called a meander neck cutoff. Once this happens, the abandoned meander bend becomes separated from the main flow of the river as deposition seals off the old channel at both ends. This creates an oxbow lake – a crescent-shaped water body that is cut off from the main river channel. Over time, oxbow lakes may fill with sediment and vegetation, eventually becoming marshy areas called meander scars.',

    markScheme: 'Tourism can bring both benefits and costs to developing countries, and the balance between these varies depending on how tourism is managed and the specific context of the country.\n\nEconomic benefits of tourism are substantial for many developing countries. In the Maldives, for example, tourism contributes approximately 66% of the country\'s GDP and is the largest foreign exchange earner. Tourism creates both direct employment in hotels, restaurants, and tour operations, and indirect employment in sectors like agriculture, construction, and handicrafts. In Costa Rica, ecotourism has created around 150,000 jobs and generates over $1.6 billion annually. Tourism also brings infrastructure development that can benefit local communities, including improved roads, airports, electricity, and water supplies, as seen in parts of Thailand where tourism development has led to better infrastructure in previously remote areas.\n\nSocially and culturally, tourism can help preserve cultural traditions and heritage. In Peru, tourism interest in traditional Andean cultures has helped revitalize traditional crafts and festivals. Tourism can also lead to cultural exchange and understanding between visitors and hosts.\n\nHowever, tourism also brings significant costs. Economic costs include leakage, where a substantial portion of tourism revenue flows out of the destination country. In Thailand, up to 70% of all money spent by tourists leaves the country via foreign-owned tour operators, airlines, hotels, and imported food and drinks. Tourism can also lead to economic dependency and vulnerability to external shocks, as demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic when tourism-dependent economies like the Maldives and Caribbean nations suffered severe economic contractions.\n\nSocial and cultural costs include potential degradation of cultural authenticity when traditions are commodified for tourists. In some parts of Thailand, traditional ceremonies have been shortened and modified to entertain tourists, losing their cultural significance. Tourism can also lead to social problems including increased crime, prostitution, and drug use in destination areas. In Goa, India, the influx of tourists has been associated with increases in drug trafficking and sex tourism.\n\nEnvironmentally, tourism often results in damage to fragile ecosystems. In the Galapagos Islands, increased visitor numbers have introduced invasive species and disturbed wildlife behavior. Resort development in coastal areas like Cancún, Mexico, has led to mangrove destruction, coral reef damage, and water pollution. Tourism also contributes to climate change through aviation emissions, which is particularly problematic for low-lying destinations like the Maldives that are threatened by sea-level rise.\n\nWhether benefits outweigh costs depends largely on the approach to tourism development. Countries that have implemented sustainable tourism practices, like Costa Rica with its certification for sustainable tourism, tend to see more balanced outcomes. Community-based tourism initiatives, such as those in parts of Kenya and Ecuador, often ensure more equitable distribution of benefits and minimize negative impacts. The time frame also matters – short-term economic gains may be offset by long-term environmental and social costs if tourism is not managed sustainably.\n\nIn conclusion, tourism can provide important economic benefits for developing countries, but these don\'t necessarily outweigh the costs in all contexts. The balance depends on factors including the scale of tourism, level of local ownership and involvement, regulatory frameworks, and commitment to sustainability principles. A carefully managed tourism sector with strong local participation and environmental protections is more likely to deliver net benefits than mass tourism dominated by international corporations.',
