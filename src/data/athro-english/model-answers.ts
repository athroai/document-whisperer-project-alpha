    ],
    markScheme: 'Throughout the extract, the writer presents their thoughts and feelings about travel as a transformative yet challenging experience. Initially, there is a sense of uncertainty and anxiety shown through phrases like "stepping into the unknown" and the metaphor of travel as "a leap into darkness." This gradually shifts to wonder and excitement, evident in the enthusiastic description of "a world opening up before me" and the simile comparing new experiences to "flashes of light illuminating previously dark corners of my mind." The writer also reflects on the personal growth that travel brings, shown through the extended metaphor of travel as "an excavation of the self." The final paragraph reveals a complex emotional response to travel – a mixture of exhaustion and exhilaration captured in the paradoxical statement that they feel "simultaneously drained and replenished."',

      'Analyze Macbeth\'s soliloquy in Act 1 Scene 7',
      'Examine Shakespeare\'s use of language to reveal character',
      'Consider Macbeth\'s moral conflict',
      'Analyze his relationship with Lady Macbeth in this scene',
      'Discuss how this scene establishes Macbeth\'s character development'
    ],
    markScheme: 'Shakespeare presents Macbeth in Act 1 Scene 7 as a character torn by moral conflict. The soliloquy that opens the scene reveals his deep hesitation about murdering King Duncan, shown through the metaphor of "bloody instructions" returning "to plague th\'inventor." Shakespeare uses conditional language ("if it were done") to emphasize Macbeth\'s indecision and reluctance. The imagery of afterlife consequences ("We still have judgment here") demonstrates his fear of moral and spiritual retribution.\n\nMacbeth is also presented as conscious of the violation of multiple sacred bonds – those of kinship ("he\'s here in double trust"), hospitality ("his host, who should against his murderer shut the door"), and loyalty as a subject to his king. This moral awareness is contrasted with his ambition, creating dramatic tension.\n\nWhen Lady Macbeth enters, Shakespeare presents Macbeth as vulnerable to manipulation, shown through his weakening resolve. Her questioning of his manhood ("When you durst do it, then you were a man") reveals his insecurity. By the end of the scene, Macbeth\'s transformation is marked by his commitment to "bend up each corporal agent to this terrible feat," showing how Shakespeare presents his character\'s tragic descent from moral hesitation to murderous resolve.',
