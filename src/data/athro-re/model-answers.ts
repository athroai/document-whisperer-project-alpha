    markScheme: 'The Five Pillars of Islam are fundamental practices that form the foundation of Muslim life. They are acts of worship that provide the framework for a Muslim\'s relationship with Allah and their community, carrying both spiritual and practical importance.\n\nThe first pillar, Shahada (Declaration of Faith), is the most important as it defines who is a Muslim. By reciting "There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is his messenger," Muslims affirm monotheism and recognize Muhammad\'s prophetic role. This declaration connects Muslims to the broader Ummah (global Muslim community) and serves as the entry point to Islam.\n\nSalah (Prayer), performed five times daily, structures a Muslim\'s day around remembrance of Allah. These regular prayers demonstrate submission to Allah and maintain a constant connection with the divine. The physical movements of prayer symbolize humility, and the recitation of Quranic verses reinforces Islamic teachings. Prayer is particularly important as it demonstrates obedience to Allah\'s commands and provides spiritual discipline.\n\nZakat (Charity) requires Muslims to give 2.5% of their eligible wealth annually to those in need. This pillar has significant social importance as it addresses wealth inequality, promotes compassion, and creates community cohesion. By purifying wealth and preventing excessive attachment to material possessions, Zakat reflects the Islamic principle that wealth ultimately belongs to Allah and humans are trustees.\n\nSawm (Fasting) during Ramadan teaches self-discipline and empathy for those less fortunate. By abstaining from food, drink, and other physical needs during daylight hours, Muslims develop taqwa (God-consciousness) and appreciate Allah\'s provisions. The communal aspects of Ramadan, such as breaking fast together, strengthen community bonds.\n\nFinally, Hajj (Pilgrimage) requires Muslims who are physically and financially able to travel to Mecca once in their lifetime. This pillar symbolizes unity and equality as pilgrims wear simple white garments removing all signs of social status. Hajj commemorates the actions of Prophet Ibrahim and represents the journey of life and submission to Allah.\n\nCollectively, these pillars create a balanced approach to faith that encompasses belief (Shahada), worship (Salah), social responsibility (Zakat), self-discipline (Sawm), and unity (Hajj). They provide Muslims with regular opportunities to demonstrate their commitment to Allah and ensure that faith influences every aspect of life. By following these pillars, Muslims maintain their individual relationship with Allah while simultaneously contributing to the welfare and cohesion of the broader community.',

      'Define religious teachings on wealth and poverty',
      'Outline key religious perspectives (Christianity, Islam, etc.)',
      'Consider arguments supporting the statement',
      'Analyze arguments against the statement',

    markScheme: 'Religious teachings on wealth and poverty reflect core ethical principles that continue to offer relevant perspectives in the modern world, although their application and interpretation have evolved to address contemporary economic realities.\n\nMany argue that traditional religious teachings on wealth and poverty are outdated in today\'s complex global economy. Christianity\'s warnings about the dangers of wealth, such as Jesus\'s statement that "it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God," may seem incompatible with modern capitalist economies. Similarly, Buddhist emphasis on detachment from material possessions could be viewed as impractical in consumer-driven societies. Critics suggest that religious texts were written in pre-industrial, agrarian societies with simpler economic systems and cannot adequately address modern issues like global supply chains, digital currencies, or automated production.\n\nAdditionally, some religious teachings on charity and almsgiving may seem insufficient to address systemic poverty. While Islam\'s requirement of Zakat (giving 2.5% of wealth) or Christianity\'s tradition of tithing provided welfare in pre-modern societies, these approaches might appear inadequate compared to modern social security systems, international development programs, or universal basic income proposals. Modern economic inequality often results from complex structural factors that individual charitable giving cannot fully address.\n\nHowever, many religious teachings contain ethical principles that remain highly relevant. Major religions consistently emphasize themes of human dignity, justice, compassion, and responsible stewardship that provide valuable frameworks for addressing contemporary economic challenges. Pope Francis\'s encyclical "Laudato Si" applies Catholic social teaching to modern environmental and economic issues, demonstrating how religious principles can address climate change and sustainable development. Similarly, Islamic finance\'s prohibition on interest (riba) has inspired ethical banking models that avoid predatory lending practices.\n\nReligious communities have also adapted their teachings to address modern forms of wealth and poverty. The World Council of Churches\' advocacy for debt cancellation for developing nations applies biblical concepts of Jubilee to international finance. Buddhist mindfulness practices have been applied to critique consumerism and promote sustainable lifestyles. These examples show how religious traditions can reinterpret core principles to address contemporary issues.\n\nFurthermore, as market-based systems have failed to eliminate poverty despite creating unprecedented wealth, religious perspectives that prioritize human well-being over profit maximization offer important counterpoints to purely economic measures of success. Religious teachings that value community, sufficiency, and care for vulnerable populations provide ethical frameworks that complement and sometimes challenge secular approaches to poverty reduction.\n\nIn conclusion, while religious teachings on wealth and poverty emerged from different historical contexts, their core ethical principles remain relevant in addressing modern economic challenges. Their continued relevance depends not on literal application of ancient economic practices, but on thoughtful reinterpretation of foundational values in contemporary contexts. Religious perspectives offer important ethical dimensions to economic discussions that purely technical or market-based approaches might overlook, suggesting that these teachings maintain significant relevance when applied with nuance to modern conditions.',
